# API_Products


## About

That project was created due to a test of my Analisys and Development of Systems and i've decided to use the framework
FastAPI because has been a while since I didn't use it and I really would like it to be my main framework, so I'm kind of
adapting and remembering about it.

Basically it's an API with integration of a database(SQLite3) and has only 1 table(Product). It's more an exercise then a big and functional project, to understand better the basics of that INCREDIBLE framework.
